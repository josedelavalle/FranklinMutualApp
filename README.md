Angular 5 Responsive Web Application for Franklin Mutual
<a target="_blank" href="https://fmi.josedelavalle.com">fmi.josedelavalle.com</a>

This is an Angular 5 application that utilizes Material Design, Bootstrap, Google Maps and Charts to allow for analyzing of Franklin Mutual agencies.  Agencies can be added to the map, with directions from the user's browser location.  An edittable limiting circle can be manipulated to only return agencies within a certain radius of desired center.  Agencies can be further filtered by a single text field that narrows down by name, address, and phone number.  Sorting capabilities of varying flavors are also provided to help you get to what you are looking for.  Found set of agencies are then transformed dynamically into a data visualization in the form of a bar graph of # of Agencies by County.

Blog entries from the Franklin Mutual Insurance website are also shown with meta data details and a link to the full article.

There is an accompanying .NET Core backend that scrapes and makes this data available, that can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/josedelavalle/FranklinMutualAPI">here</a>.
